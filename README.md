Distinguishing between Flaring and Non-Flaring Active Regions- A Machine Learning Perspectiver

In this study, our aim is to distinguish flaring active region from the non-flaring one. Active region which generates a flare during their transit over visible solar disk is called flaring region. Active region which does not generate any flare during their transit is known as non-flaring region.

We have used SDO/HMI active region magnetogram data for this study. One can download the data from JSOC website.
